## My process

This project is very similar to one I had done before (https://github.com/josuemrodrig/card-component), but unlike the previous one here I tried not to use so many containers to store my elements (h1, p, img) and I made use of the flex grow property to provide the space suitable between them, although I understand that I could use the margin button for that, I also decided to do it that way to gradually learn other ways to reach the same result or at least a similar one


### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox


### Continued development

At this point I am trying to use what I have learned about html and css, at the same time I am learning javascript concepts, I hope in the future to start doing small projects using this language.
